## preface
> Modern C++ can be thought of as comprising three parts:
> 1 - The low-level language, much of which is inherited from C
> 2 - More advanced language features that allow us to define our own types and to organize large-scale programs and system
> 3 - The standard library, which uses these advanced features to provide useful data structures and algorithms

## 1.1 Writing a Simple C++ Program
---
- Every C++ Program Contains one or more **Functions**, One of which must be named **main**.
- The OS runs the C++ program by calling **main**.
```cpp
//Here is a simple version of main that does nothing but return a value:
int main()
{
	return 0;
}
```
- A function definition has four elements:
	1 - a **==return type==**.
	2 - a **==function name==**.
	3 - a **==parameter list==**(enclosed in parentheses).
	4 - a **==function body==**.
- The **main** function must have a return type of **int**.
- A **Function Body** is a block of statements starting with an open curly brace and ending with another.
- The **return** statement is a statement that terminates a function.
- The **return** statement can also send a value back to  the function.
> The return value must have a type that is compatible with the return type of the function.
- Semicolons mark the end of most statements in C++.
> On most systems, the value returned from main is a status indicator. A return value of 0 indicates success. A nonzero return has a meaning that is defined by the system. Ordinarily a nonzero return indicates what kind of error occurred.
- **==Types==** are one of the most fundamental concepts in programming.
- A **Type** define both the contents of a data element and the operations that are possible on those data.
- **Data** are stored in **Variables** and every **Variables** has a **Type**.
